# WEB SCRAPER IN PYTHON
This python script scans through HTML from a URL, cleans and returns the content in a list of dictionaries


---
## DESCRIPTION
In this particular context, the script gets the number of branded blenders from the site: https://www.jumia.co.ke/catalog/?q=blender.
The Product Name, Price and Rating are stored in a dictionary for each item and appended to a list.
The entries are then compared to another dictionary that contains specific brands to determine how many times each brand occurs in the list of all products


---
## RUNNING THE SCRIPT
Download the zip file from the repo and unzip it to your preferred location.
Open the command prompt/shell and change the file directory to where the script sits.
Run the script by: python scriptName.py
